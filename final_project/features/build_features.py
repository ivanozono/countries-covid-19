"""
This script is part of the data processing pipeline of the 'final_project'. It contains
functions and logic to transform raw data into features suitable for exploratory data analysis
or modeling. The transformations might include scaling, normalization, encoding categorical 
variables, handling missing values, and more, depending on the project's specific needs.

Functions within this script are intended to be imported and used by notebooks or other scripts 
for data preparation before any in-depth analysis or model training. By centralizing feature 
building logic here, we maintain consistency and reproducibility across different analyses 
and modeling efforts within the project.

Usage:
This module is to be imported where feature construction or transformation is required.
Example:
    from final_project.features import build_features
