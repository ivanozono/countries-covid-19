"""
This module, part of the 'final_project', is focused on the training phase of the machine learning
workflow. It encapsulates the logic and routines necessary to take processed data and use it to
train machine learning models. This could involve tasks such as feature selection, model selection,
hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and the actual fitting of models to the training data.

The functions defined in this module are meant to be imported and utilized by other scripts or
notebooks that handle the model training process. This modular approach ensures that the training
logic is consistent and can be easily updated or modified as the project evolves.

Usage:
This module should be imported in the context of model training, typically before the prediction
phase.
Example:
    from final_project.models import train_model
