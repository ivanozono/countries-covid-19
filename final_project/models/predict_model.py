"""
This module is part of the 'final_project' and is dedicated to the prediction phase
of the modeling process. It defines functions and routines that apply the trained
models to input data to generate predictions. These predictions could be the output
of a classification, regression, or any other machine learning model developed within 
the project.

The module is structured to be used after models have been trained and validated,
serving as the final step where the model's utility is realized through making
predictions on new or test data.

Usage:
This module is to be imported in the scripts or notebooks where model predictions are
needed, typically after model training and evaluation have been completed.
Example:
    from final_project.models import predict_model
