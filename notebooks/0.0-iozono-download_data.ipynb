Its main purpose is to establish a systematic and reproducible process for downloading the datasets needed for later phases of the project. This process includes identifying relevant data sources, implementing efficient and secure methods for downloading, and verifying the integrity and quality of the obtained data. This structured approach ensures that our subsequent analysis is based on complete, accurate, and reliable data.\n"
