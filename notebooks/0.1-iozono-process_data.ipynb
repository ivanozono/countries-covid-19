    "1. **Understanding the Dataset:** Gaining a clear view of the structure, content, and peculiarities of the data we have collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation:** Implementing cleaning and transformation steps to convert raw data into a more usable and meaningful format for future analysis.\n",

    "1. **Importing Project's Paths Module (`paths`):**\n",
    "   - `import final_project.utils.paths as path`:\n",
    "     - Here, we import the `paths` module from the `final_project.utils` package. This module is used for managing file and directory paths within the project, which facilitates organized and coherent path management. Importing it as `path` allows us to access these predefined paths more simply and directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Importing the `janitor` Library:**\n",
    "   - `import janitor`:\n",
    "     - `janitor` is a library that provides data cleaning functions for Pandas, making common data cleaning tasks easier and improving code readability. These functions include, among others, cleaning column names, removing duplicate rows, and managing missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Importing Pandas:**\n",
    "   - `import pandas as pd`:\n",
    "     - Pandas is an essential library in data science for manipulating and analyzing data in Python. Its main data structure, the DataFrame, allows for easy manipulation of tabular data with numerous operations for filtering, sorting, and summarizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries form the foundation of our data processing environment, enabling us to efficiently handle data from loading to cleaning and preparing it for subsequent analysis.\n"
